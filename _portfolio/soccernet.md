## About
Participated to the international [SoccerNet 2023 challenge's action spotting task](https://www.soccer-net.org/challenges/2023) to detect actions that occur during football matches.

Finished 5th out of 12 teams.

It also led to a publication: [Paper Link](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2024W/Pretrain/papers/Denize_COMEDIAN_Self-Supervised_Learning_and_Knowledge_Distillation_for_Action_Spotting_Using_WACVW_2024_paper.pdf).
