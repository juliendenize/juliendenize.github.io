Pixano is an open-source tool by CEA List for exploring and annotating your dataset using AI features such as:
- Fast dataset navigation using the the modern storage format Lance
- Multi-view datasets support for images, and soon for 3D point clouds and videos
- Import and export support for dataset formats like COCO
- Semantic search using models like CLIP
- Smart segmentation using models like SAM
