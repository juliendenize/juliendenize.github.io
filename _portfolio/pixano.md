## About

Pixano is an open-source tool by CEA List for exploring and annotating your dataset using AI features.

Led a team of 3 people to develop an open-source AI-powered annotation and data management tool web platform for multi-modal data. It enables users to visualize their data, annotate by hand or by using AI models and manipulate their data via a REST API or a Python API.Pixano is an open-source tool by CEA List for exploring and annotating your dataset using AI features.
