## About
Eztorch is a library to make training, validation, and testing in Pytorch easy to perform image and video self-supervised representation learning and evaluate those representations on downstream tasks.

It was first developed to factorize code during Julien Denize's PhD thesis which was on Self-supervised representation learning and applications to image and video analysis. It led to several academic contributions:
- Similarity Contrastive Estimation for Self-Supervised Soft Contrastive Learning (WACV 2023)
- Similarity Contrastive Estimation for Image and Video Soft Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (MVAP 2023)
- COMEDIAN: Self-Supervised Learning and Knowledge Distillation for Action Spotting using Transformers (WACV Workshops 2024)

To ease the use of the code, [documentation](https://juliendenize.github.io/eztorch/index.html) has been built.
