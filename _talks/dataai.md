Speaker for the [DATAAI institute](https://dataia.eu/en) at the Workshop Franco-Allemand *Computer Vision* that brought together German and French researchers on various subjects. I presented our work **Similarity Contrastive Estimation for Self-Supervised Soft Contrastive Learning**, later published.
