Taught how to effectively use the internal HPC cluster to optimize Deep Learning experiments.

The course included:
- SLURM Tutorial:
    - Principles of nodes, jobs, submissions, queue
    - How to submit a job
        - configuration to maximize usage of partition resources
        - multi-node and multi-process setting
- Pytorch Tutorial:
    - Dataloader
    - Distributed training
        - along with SLURM by using set environment variables 
    - Avoid CPU/GPU synchronization

After this course, a noticable number of experiments were achieved faster on the cluster and computational resources were better used.
