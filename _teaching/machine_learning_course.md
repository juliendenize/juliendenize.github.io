The course was taking place in the [M2 Big Data Management and Analytics (BDMA)](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/formation/master/informatique/m2-big-data-management-and-analytics-bdma) and taught in English as the students were all registered to Erasmus or Erasmus Mundus.

I taught deep learning basics for computer vision, natural language processing, and generative models. The objective was to give keys to understand Deep Learning either to pursue in a technical career or to be able to manage teams for projects relying on AI technologies and more specifically deep learning.
