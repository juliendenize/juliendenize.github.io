I am a PhD candidate working in collaboration with the [Laboratoire de Vision et d'Apprentissage pour l'analyse de scène](https://kalisteo.cea.fr/index.php/ai/)(LVA) in [CEA List](https://list.cea.fr/fr/) and the [Laboratoire d'informatique, du Traitement de l'Information et des Systèmes](https://www.litislab.fr/)(LITIS) in [INSA Rouen](https://www.insa-rouen.fr/). My thesis subject is **"Self-supervised representation learning and applications for image and video analysis"**. I worked under the supervision of [Romain Hérault](https://rherault.pages.insa-rouen.fr/website/pages/welcome-fr.html), Jaonary Rabarisoa and Astrid Orcesi.

I got a Master of Engineering in Computer Science from [Télécom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/) with a major in Artificial Intelligence. I completed my diploma with a 6-months research internship focused on **"People re-identification and cross-domain adaptation via generative models"**.

For several years now, my education and works are drawn to Maths and Computer Science, therefore Artificial Intelligence is and will be one of my passion especially today with the field having fast (**really fast**) advances.

I am **open to work** starting early 2024 and I am looking for a **Machine Learning Engineer** job with an Ops philosophy.

I would be more than happy to hear from you, do not hesitate to contact me !
