##  Software and ML Engineer | MLOps | PhD in Deep Learning | Aspiring Full-Stack Developer 

I am a software and machine learning engineer with 4+ years of experience specializing in AI, backend development, and increasingly in full-stack engineering. After earning a PhD in Deep Learning, I transitioned from research to engineering, focusing on building MLOps pipelines to streamline AI training, design, and deployment processes. While my core expertise lies in backend technologies (Python, FastAPI, databases), I am actively expanding into frontend development. I have a strong foundation in CI/CD, automation, and web development, allowing me to deliver scalable and high-performance AI solutions.

## Current Role: Machine Learning Engineer at CEA List
Since February 2024, I’ve been working at [CEA List](https://list.cea.fr/fr/), where I lead the development of MLOps pipelines in an R&D team of 80 people. Our team focuses on creating innovative AI models in NLP and Computer Vision. My role involves enhancing software engineering and DevOps practices to streamline the work of research scientists, helping to scale their proof-of-concept models into deployable, production-ready solutions.

## Academic Background
I completed my PhD in collaboration with the [Laboratoire de Vision et d'Apprentissage pour l'analyse de scène](https://kalisteo.cea.fr/index.php/ai/)(LVA) at CEA List and the [Laboratoire d'informatique, du Traitement de l'Information et des Systèmes](https://www.litislab.fr/)(LITIS) at [INSA Rouen](https://www.insa-rouen.fr/). My thesis, titled "Self-supervised representation learning and applications for image and video analysis", was supervised by [Romain Hérault](https://rherault.pages.insa-rouen.fr/website/pages/welcome-fr.html), Jaonary Rabarisoa, and Astrid Orcesi. This work laid the foundation for my expertise in AI, particularly in self-supervised learning for visual data.

Prior to that, I earned a Master of Science in Computer Science from [Télécom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/), with a major in Artificial Intelligence. During my studies, I completed a 6-month research internship, focusing on "People re-identification and cross-domain adaptation via generative models."
