I am a Machine Learing Engineer at the [CEA List](https://list.cea.fr/fr/) since February 2024. I am in charge of developing an **MLOps task** in a R&D service of 80 people **to build new cool AI models in NLP and Computer Vision**. To do so, I increase my skills in Software Engineering and DevOps with currently a primary focus on Machine Learning. I also help scaling research scientist's POCs.

Previously, I obtained a PhD by working in collaboration with the [Laboratoire de Vision et d'Apprentissage pour l'analyse de scène](https://kalisteo.cea.fr/index.php/ai/)(LVA) in [CEA List](https://list.cea.fr/fr/) and the [Laboratoire d'informatique, du Traitement de l'Information et des Systèmes](https://www.litislab.fr/)(LITIS) in [INSA Rouen](https://www.insa-rouen.fr/). My thesis subject was **"Self-supervised representation learning and applications for image and video analysis"**. I worked under the supervision of [Romain Hérault](https://rherault.pages.insa-rouen.fr/website/pages/welcome-fr.html), Jaonary Rabarisoa and Astrid Orcesi.

I got a Master of Engineering in Computer Science from [Télécom SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/) with a major in Artificial Intelligence. I completed my diploma with a 6-months research internship focused on **"People re-identification and cross-domain adaptation via generative models"**.

I would be more than happy to hear from you, do not hesitate to contact me !
